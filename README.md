# Project_One_2020EKTPHB

Our project is to analyze the effects of Hurricane Harvey on the Houston housing market.  We looked at seven metrics as listed below (definition of terms at end of file):

Age of Inventory 
Days on Zillow
Median Price Reduction
Median Sales Price
Montly Home Sales
Monthly Market Value
New Monthly Listings

Data analytics summary â€“ Line graphs tell us that age of inventory, days on zillow, median price reduction and to a lesser extent median sales price were influenced by HH. Monthly home sales, monthly market value, new monthly listings were not.  

T test results summary: Monthly Market Value data analyzed in a correlated pairs test.  Population is Houston data 1996-2019.  Sample data is 4 months of data for each of seven major hurricanes or tropical storms from 1998-2019.  Our p value is less than 0.05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no deifference between the means.  Out T score is 5.84.  This means that our samples are approximately 6 times as different from each other as they are within each other.


Definitions:
All Homes: Zillow defines all homes as single-family, condominium and co-operative homes with a county record. Unless specified, all series cover this segment of the housing stock.
Condo/Co-op: Condominium and co-operative homes.

Median Sale Price ($): Median of the selling price for all homes sold in a given region.

Median price cut (%): Median of the percentage price reduction for homes with a price reduction during the month.

Monthly Inventory: The count of unique listings that were active at any time in a given month.

New Monthly Inventory: The count of unique listings that were newly listed at any time in a given month.

Age of Inventory: Each Wednesday, age of inventory is calculated as the median number of days all active listings as of that Wednesday have been current. These medians are then aggregated into the number reported by taking the median across weekly values.

Days on Zillow: The median days on market of homes sold within a given month, including foreclosure re-sales. The latest data is for one month prior to the current ZHVI (e.g., if the most current month for ZHVI data is January, the most current month for Days on Zillow data will be December).

Home Sales: The number of homes sold during a given month. Note: ZIP code sales data is not latency adjusted, but is filtered.
